## **Question 2:**  

*What are the most important aspects of quality software?*

Quality software can be broadly defined as the extent to which the system meets the needs of the end users. Furthermore, these needs are listed in ISO/IEC 25010 and include the attributes shown below (Iso25000.com, 2022).

1. Functional suitability: is an important quality characteristic that represents how well a software product meets the explicit and implicit needs of its users. This quality characteristic has three sub-attributes:
    - *Functional completeness*, which relates to the degree to which the system provides all the functions stipulated by the users.
    - *Functional correctness*, pertains to the ability of the system to produce the correct results with the right amount of precision.
    - *Functional Appropriateness*, is the capacity of the software only run the functions necessary to achieve the tasks required by the users.

2. Performance efficiency: relates to the performance of the system relative to the size of the resources used under certain conditions. The quality characteristic it comprised of a number sub-attributes:
    - *Time behaviour* is essentially the time it takes for the system to execute its functions. Faster processing time is typically more desirable.
    - *Use of resources* relates to the amount of resources used by the software product when performing tasks. Minimal use of resources like memory and storage to achieve desired outcomes is desirable.  
    - *Capacity* involves the maximum limit of the product and how well this meets the system requirements.
